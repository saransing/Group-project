<p class="box">After a long day of traveling or sightseeing, there is nothing like a refreshing dip in the pool.
     Our 25 meter lapping pool does not only make you feel good after a plunge or a couple of laps, 
    but also from the fact that it is sustainably heated by the excess heat from Overlook's cooling systems. 
    To reduce our carbon footprint, we have teamed up with Inosole, giving you the opportunity to buy a pair of sustainable slippers, made out of recycled rubber from tires. 
    You are also welcome to bring your own.</p>
